A custom wordpress site 

Developed using local by flywheel for local develepment, Plugins used are ACF to handle the custom data and Custom Post Types.
For SCSS I used my own default modules which are using flexbox and CSS Grid for layouts.

The wordpress theme was setup by the lead developer. for this site I prefered using the page method of building the custom wordpress site. as still not a fan of the wordpress blocks.
As this site will hardly be customised, since the client dosn't have too much knowledge with design or development. 

I wanted to minismise there capabilities inside wordpress just to the Pages & Posts, as well as some additional admin options I made for them.
